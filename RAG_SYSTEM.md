## Testing

Try these queries in the chat:
1. "What products do you offer?"
2. "What's your return policy?"
3. "How do I authenticate with the API?"
4. "Show me all available documentation"
5. "What are the pricing tiers?"

The agent will automatically use the RAG tools to search the knowledge base and provide accurate, sourced answers.
